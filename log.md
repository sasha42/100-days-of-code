# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've been able to find a library that detects light pulses over the getUserMedia api, and was able to transmit pulses over a small script that changes color every 500ms. Looked at [HeartRate](https://github.com/gfwilliams/HeartRate) library for inspiration.

**Thoughts** Wasn't able to get an infinite loop running :/

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Generating a light pulse in JS](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ggYyQa)


### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Played with methods to change LED strips smoothly, looked into how [this](https://github.com/apexskier/ledDriver) library implemented it. Not much progress.

**Thoughts** Had a hard time focusing on the code, tried a number of different methods and didn't find something that worked well.
