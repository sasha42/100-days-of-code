# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've been able to find a library that detects light pulses over the getUserMedia api, and was able to transmit pulses over a small script that changes color every 500ms. Looked at [HeartRate](https://github.com/gfwilliams/HeartRate) library for inspiration.

**Thoughts** Wasn't able to get an infinite loop running :/
