# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've been able to find a library that detects light pulses over the getUserMedia api, and was able to transmit pulses over a small script that changes color every 500ms. Looked at [HeartRate](https://github.com/gfwilliams/HeartRate) library for inspiration.

**Thoughts** Wasn't able to get an infinite loop running :/

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Generating a light pulse in JS](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ggYyQa)


### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Played with methods to change LED strips smoothly, looked into how [this](https://github.com/apexskier/ledDriver) library implemented it. Not much progress.

**Thoughts** Had a hard time focusing on the code, tried a number of different methods and didn't find something that worked well.

### Day 3: January 5th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Played with more methods to change LEDs smoothly. Distilled code down to its essense and created a loop to test out various methods of cycling smoothly. 

**Thoughts** Got stuck installing jupyter notebook on the Pi. Need to find a better way to focus.

### Day 4: January 6th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Played with more methods to change LEDs smoothly. Actually got something to work from the [library I treid on Wednesday](https://github.com/apexskier/ledDriver)! Also discovered the `echo "hello" | wall` which sends messages to other connected users ;).

**Thoughts** Good hacking. Will hack into the night.

**Link(s) to work** (soon)

### Day 5: January 9th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Played with more methods to change LEDs smoothly again, figured out that there is actually a limitation with time accuracy on the Pi - moving onto hardware to smoothen out the signal. Played a bit with code but mostly just debugging.

**Thoughts** Kinda bummed out that I didn't code on the weekend. Happy to see progress on a project that I rarely get time to work on!
